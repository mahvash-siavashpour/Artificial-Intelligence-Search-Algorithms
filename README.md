# Artificial-Intelligence-Search-Algorithms
 In this project three different search algorithms were implemented using Java in irder to solve Hanabi card game. The search algorithms implemented are as follow:<br>
 - BFS
 - IDS
 - A*

 <br>
 In this projects the input can ba any state in a Hanabi card game and these algorithms can predict the number of steps needed to solve the game and can print all the steps until the final result.
 Sample input:
